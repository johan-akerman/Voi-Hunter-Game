# Cookie Clicker - Voi Scooters Edition 🛴

My first React JS project was a simple cookie clicker game with a Voi scooters theme. It is responsive and works both on desktop and mobile. It is built with React and Bootstrap and it stores the players progress in the browsers cookies. It's a cookie clicker game, what did you expect? 😉🍪

## How to play

1. Help Voi collect their uncharged scooters by clicking on them on the map.
2. Buy various upgrades in the shop and improve your count per second (CPS). 
3. Keep on clicking and help Voi collect as many scooters as possible. It is an endless game. 
4. Keep track of your progress in the "stats" tab.
5. Want to start over? Restart the game in the "settings" tab.
